# A meditative technique

While working at Typeform, we had a weekly mindfulness session in the basement run by a professional coach. About 10 of us used to join and we’d sit in quiet, listening to calming music, and Kasia, the coach, would guide us through a kind of meditation.

She provided the high level instruction: “imagine your problem, the thing that is annoying or consuming you, imagine it very clearly, then let go of it”.

The manner in which I let go of it was up to me. For me, the way that worked best and that I enjoyed the most, was imagining the problem inside a bubble. I’m underwater, and my problem is inside a little bubble, that I guess I’m also in - because my problem and I are one. Then I imagine leaving the bubble and watching my problem slowly drift, floating away from me up towards the surface and out of my mind.

This exercise really helps me to let go. I can drive myself crazy overthinking, letting a worry or concern circle around my head, resisting every mediation I try to dispel it. This exercise allows me to put the problem into perspective - it’s a thing, and a view - a view from which I cannot look away. But putting it inside the bubble and allowing it to float way from me, with no effort, with as much ease as an air bubble floats up towards the atmosphere, allows me to relax.
